🔥 FORCE CHROME TO RELOAD EXTENSION 🔥

Chrome is caching the old UI. Follow these EXACT steps:

1️⃣ CLOSE CHROME COMPLETELY:
   - Quit Chrome (Cmd+Q on Mac, or Chrome menu → Quit)
   - Make sure NO Chrome processes are running

2️⃣ CLEAR EXTENSION CACHE:
   Open Terminal and run:
   
   rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/paabmognifcbmcfalhcfbcnfbffdkeba
   
   (This deletes the old cached extension data)

3️⃣ RESTART CHROME:
   - Open Chrome fresh
   - Go to: chrome://extensions/

4️⃣ LOAD EXTENSION:
   - Make sure "Developer mode" is ON
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select: /Users/mosman/Documents/DVLA BOT/READY_TO_DEPLOY_EXTENSION
   - Click "Select Folder"

5️⃣ VERIFY:
   - Click extension icon
   - You should see BLUE GRADIENT header (not green!)
   - Stats should be in glass-morphism cards

If you STILL see green header, the browser is using cached HTML.
Try opening in Incognito mode or a different Chrome profile.
