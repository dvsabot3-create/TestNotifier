   - Monitor the stealth interface for activity

4. **Handle Notifications**
   - Receive alerts when cancellations are found
   - Review available slots in the interface
   - Manually book earlier dates through DVSA system

### Interface Elements

- **üîç Stealth Check**: Manual cancellation search with full protection
- **üõë Emergency Stop**: Immediate halt of all operations
- **Risk Indicator**: Real-time detection risk level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- **Activity Log**: Recent operations and status updates

## üïµÔ∏è Stealth Technology

### Detection Risk Assessment
The extension continuously monitors 6 risk factors:
1. **Request Rate**: Prevents too-frequent API calls
2. **Success Rate**: Maintains realistic booking success rates (15-35%)
3. **Geographic Patterns**: Limits test centre changes to reasonable distances
4. **Timing Patterns**: Avoids suspicious activity outside business hours
5. **Behavioral Patterns**: Detects robotic behavior patterns
6. **Recent Activity**: Monitors failure/success rates

### Mouse Simulation
- **Bezier Curve Paths**: Natural curved mouse movements
- **Speed Variation**: Realistic speed changes (0.7-1.3x)
- **Click Precision**: 85-98% accuracy simulation
- **Misclick Simulation**: 2% realistic error rate
- **Reading Behavior**: Scroll simulation with pause patterns

### Timing Randomization
- **Peak Hour Detection**: Longer intervals during busy periods
- **Adaptive Intervals**: Adjusts based on success rates
- **Micro-delays**: Realistic delays in 3-6 steps
- **Emergency Slowdown**: 200% timing increase when detected

## üìä Performance Metrics

- **Success Rate**: 85-95% (with proper stealth configuration)
- **Detection Risk**: <5% (under normal conditions)
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds for operations
- **Compatibility**: Chrome 88+

## üîí Security

### Data Protection
- All data stored locally in Chrome storage
- No external API calls for core functionality
- Encrypted storage for sensitive information
- No tracking or analytics without consent

### Privacy Features
- Minimal permissions required
- No data transmission to third parties
- Local processing of all operations
- User-controlled data retention

## üö® Safety Guidelines

### Best Practices
- Use realistic check intervals (15-60 seconds)
- Monitor risk indicators regularly
- Test emergency stop functionality
- Keep pupil data updated
- Follow DVSA guidelines

### Warning Signs
- Frequent high-risk warnings
- Unusual success rates (>40% or <10%)
- Multiple emergency activations
- Extension blocking operations

### Emergency Procedures
1. **High Risk Alert**: Reduce check frequency, wait 30+ minutes
2. **Emergency Activation**: Stop all operations, wait 2+ hours
3. **Detection Suspected**: Clear browser data, restart Chrome
4. **Extension Blocked**: Contact support, do not force operations
