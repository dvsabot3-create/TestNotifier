**We need to see what happens WHEN you click Sign In**

---

## 📋 **DO THIS RIGHT NOW:**

### **Step 1: Open Render Logs**
```
https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d42iob6r433s73dmlpt0
Click: "Logs" tab (left sidebar)
```

### **Step 2: Scroll to Bottom**
Scroll all the way down - you should see:
```
==> Your service is live 🎉
```

### **Step 3: WHILE WATCHING LOGS - Try Sign In**

**In another browser tab:**
1. Go to: https://testnotifier.co.uk
2. Click "Sign In"
3. Click Google sign-in button
4. Click your Google account

**KEEP WATCHING THE RENDER LOGS TAB!**

---

## 👀 **WHAT TO LOOK FOR:**

As soon as you click your Google account, Render logs should show:

```
🔐 Google OAuth initiated with redirect: /dashboard
🔐 GoogleStrategy: Preserving state: /dashboard
✅ Google OAuth callback - redirect URL: /dashboard (from userData.state)
```

**OR you'll see:**

```
Google OAuth callback error: [SOME ERROR MESSAGE]
```

---

## 📸 **SEND ME:**

**Take a screenshot of the logs showing:**
1. The `🔐 Google OAuth initiated` line
2. Any lines that appear after that
3. Any error messages (red or yellow)
4. The full error context

---

## 🎯 **WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR:**

**If logs show:**
```
🔐 GoogleStrategy: Preserving state: ...
✅ Google OAuth callback - redirect URL: ...
✅ User created/found in database
🔀 Redirecting to: https://testnotifier.co.uk/auth/callback?accessToken=...
```
**Then OAuth is WORKING!** Issue is elsewhere.

**If logs show:**
```
Google OAuth callback error: redirect_uri_mismatch
```
**Then:** Google Console redirect URI is wrong.

**If logs show:**
```
Google OAuth callback error: invalid_client
```
**Then:** Client ID/Secret mismatch.

**If logs show:**
```
Google OAuth callback error: null
```
**Then:** Google sent empty response (user cancelled or session expired).

---

## ⏰ **TIMING:**

**Important:** The logs appear IN REAL-TIME as you sign in.

**So:**
1. Open Render logs
2. Scroll to bottom
3. Click sign-in on website
4. Watch logs update LIVE
5. Screenshot the new lines that appear

**Do this now and send me the screenshot of what appears in logs when you click sign-in! 🔍**
