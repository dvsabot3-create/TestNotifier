# Stripe Checkout Branding - Implementation Summary

## Problem

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Checkout Session Configuration
**File**: `website/api/create-checkout-session.js`
- Added custom submit messages based on plan type
- Added professional messaging for subscriptions and one-time payments
- Configured to work with Stripe's branding settings

### 2. Automated Branding Setup Script
**File**: `website/scripts/setup-stripe-branding.js`
- Programmatically sets up Stripe Checkout branding
- Uploads logo (TestNotifier logo)
- Sets brand colors (Navy Blue #1d70b8)
- Configures payment statement descriptor

### 3. Documentation
**File**: `STRIPE_CHECKOUT_BRANDING.md`
- Complete setup guide
- Automated and manual setup options
- Brand asset requirements
- Testing checklist

## Brand Identity Applied

### Colors
- **Primary**: `#1d70b8` (Navy Blue) - matches website
- **Background**: `#ffffff` (White)
