# ❌ Subscription Error Still Happening - Troubleshooting

## 🔍 **Why The Error Is Still There**

The error "There was an error processing your request" means either:

1. ❌ **Stripe keys in Vercel are still placeholders** (not real keys)
2. ❌ **Environment variables not added to Vercel yet**
3. ❌ **Stripe products not created yet**
4. ❌ **Server not redeployed after adding variables**

## ✅ **What You Need to Do**

### **Step 1: Check If You Added Variables to Vercel**

Go to:
1. https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your **testnotifier.co.uk** project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Check if you see these variables:
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Is it a real key or still `sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key_here`?
   - `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Is it real or a placeholder?
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Do you have this?

### **Step 2: If Variables Have Placeholder Values**

You need to replace them with **real values** from Stripe:

1. **Get Real Stripe Secret Key**
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard → API keys
   - Copy the real `sk_test_51SJt2C1EIYN...` (full key)
   - Update in Vercel

2. **Get Real Publishable Key**
   - Copy the real `pk_test_51SJt2C1EIYN...`
   - Update in Vercel

3. **Get Real Webhook Secret**
   - Go to Developers → Webhooks
   - Click on your webhook
   - Copy the `whsec_...` secret
   - Add to Vercel

### **Step 3: Redeploy on Vercel**

After updating variables:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **"Redeploy"** on latest deployment
3. Wait for deployment to complete
4. Test again

## 🎯 **Quick Check**

Can you confirm:
- ✅ Did you go to Vercel dashboard?
- ✅ Did you add the Stripe keys to Vercel?
- ✅ Are the keys REAL (not placeholders)?
- ✅ Did you redeploy after adding?

If NO to any of these, that's why it's still failing! 🚨

## 📋 **Required Real Values**

Your Vercel environment variables need:
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51SJt2C1EIYNsLBOG_full_key_here
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51SJt2C1EIYNsLBOG_full_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_full_secret_here
```

NOT:
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key_here  ❌
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key_here  ❌
```
