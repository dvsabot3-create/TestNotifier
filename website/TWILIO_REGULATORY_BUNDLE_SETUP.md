## ⚠️ **Important Notes:**

### **Bundle Requirements:**
- ✅ UK business address required
- ✅ Business description required
- ✅ Use case information required
- ⏳ Approval takes time (minutes to days)

### **For Test/Trial Use:**
- You already have a **US number**: `+19789973013`
- This works for SMS testing immediately
- You can test the SMS functionality NOW with your US number
- UK number needed only for production

## 🎯 **Alternative: Use US Number for Testing**

Since you already have a working US number:

1. **Skip the UK number for now**
2. **Use your existing US number**: `+19789973013`
3. **Test SMS functionality** with the US number first
4. **Buy UK number later** when you need production deployment

## 📋 **Quick Decision:**

**Option A: Test with US Number (Faster)**
- Use `+19789973013` already configured
- Start testing immediately
- No regulatory bundle needed
- Works for development/testing

**Option B: Wait for UK Number (Production)**
- Create regulatory bundle
- Wait for approval
- Buy UK number
- Use for UK customers in production

## 🤔 **Recommendation:**

**Use the US number (`+19789973013`) for now!**
- It's already configured
- No setup required
- Works immediately
- You can test SMS right away
- Buy UK number later when you're ready for production

The messages will still work for testing purposes! 🚀
