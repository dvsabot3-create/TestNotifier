# How to Get Your Full Stripe API Keys

## üîë **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **1. In Your Stripe Dashboard**

You're currently on the dashboard showing the API keys box. Here's what to do:

**Option A: Click on the key itself**
1. Find the "Secret key" value in the box: `sk_test_51SJt2C1EIYN...`
2. **Click directly on the key** - it should expand to show the full key
3. **Click the copy icon** (clipboard icon) next to the key to copy the full value

**Option B: Use the "Reveal" button**
1. Look for a **"Reveal"** or **"Show test key"** button next to the Secret key
2. Click it to reveal the full key
3. Click the **copy icon** to copy it

### **2. Same for Publishable Key**

1. Find the "Publishable key" value: `pk_test_51SJt2C1EIYN...`
2. Click on it or use "Reveal" to see the full key
3. Click the copy icon to copy it

### **3. Quick Shortcut**

The Stripe dashboard often has a **"Copy API key"** link in the API keys box. Click that to copy the full secret key.

## üìã **What You Need to Copy**

From your dashboard, I can see you have:
- **Publishable key**: `pk_test_51SJt2C1EIYN...` (needs full version)
- **Secret key**: `sk_test_51SJt2C1EIYN...` (needs full version)

These are truncated (shortened) versions. You need to reveal or click them to get the **full keys**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**

- The `...` means the key is truncated for security
- Click on the key or use "Reveal" to see the complete key
- The full secret key will be about 32 characters longer

## üéØ **Alternative Method**

If clicking doesn't work:

1. Look for a **"API keys"** link at the top of the page
2. Or go to **Developers** section in the left sidebar (at the bottom)
3. Then click **"API keys"** in the Developers menu
4. There you'll see the full keys with "Reveal" buttons

Once you click to reveal and copy the full keys, paste them here and I'll update your `.env.local` file! üöÄ
