# ✅ Google OAuth Configuration Status

## 🎯 **What I See in Your Screenshot:**

✅ **Authorized JavaScript origins:**
- `https://testnotifier.co.uk` ✅

✅ **Authorized redirect URIs:**
- `https://website-gcc50mjsu-test-notifiers-projects.vercel.app/auth/call` ← Has a typo!
- `https://testnotifier.co.uk/auth/callback` ✅

## 🔧 **Issue Found:**

One of your redirect URIs is **incomplete**:
```
https://website-gcc50mjsu-test-notifiers-projects.vercel.app/auth/call
```

It says `/auth/call` but should be `/auth/callback` (missing 'back')

## ✅ **What You Should Have:**

Your authorized redirect URIs should include:
1. `https://website-gcc50mjsu-test-notifiers-projects.vercel.app/auth/callback` (FIX the typo)
2. `https://testnotifier.co.uk/auth/callback` ✅ (this one is correct)

## 🔧 **How to Fix:**

1. In your Google Cloud Console (where you are now)
2. Find the redirect URI that says `/auth/call`
3. Click on it to edit
4. Change it to: `/auth/callback` (add 'back')
5. Click "Save"
6. Wait a few minutes for changes to propagate

## 📋 **Final Authorized Redirect URIs Should Be:**

```
https://website-gcc50mjsu-test-notifiers-projects.vercel.app/auth/callback
https://testnotifier.co.uk/auth/callback
```

## 🎉 **Everything Else Looks Good!**

- ✅ Client ID is correct
- ✅ Client secret is enabled
- ✅ JavaScript origins are correct
- ✅ Name is "TestNotifier"
- ✅ Just needs the redirect URI typo fixed!

Let me know when you've fixed the typo! 🚀
