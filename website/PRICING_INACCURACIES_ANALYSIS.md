## üéØ Most Critical Issues

### **1. Professional Plan "Unlimited" Claims - LEGAL RISK**
```javascript
// PRICING SECTION (FALSE):
{ text: "UNLIMITED pupils & test centers", included: true }
{ text: "UNLIMITED rebooks (zero extra fees)", included: true }

// ACTUAL SYSTEM (TRUE):
- Maximum 20 pupils (not unlimited)
- Maximum 10 daily booking attempts (not unlimited)
- Maximum 50 daily notifications (not unlimited)
```

**Legal Risk**: This constitutes **false advertising** under UK consumer protection laws.

### **2. Time Period Confusion - BUSINESS LOGIC ERROR**
```javascript
// PRICING SECTION (WRONG):
"2 rebooks included per month"     // Starter
"5 rebooks included per month"     // Premium
"UNLIMITED rebooks"                // Professional

// ACTUAL SYSTEM (CORRECT):
"2 daily booking attempts"         // Starter
"5 daily booking attempts"         // Premium
"10 daily booking attempts"        // Professional
```

**Business Impact**: Customers expect monthly quotas but get daily limits.

### **3. Non-Existent "Extra Rebooks" Feature**
```javascript
// PRICING SECTION (FEATURE DOESN'T EXIST):
"Extra rebooks at ¬£15 each"        // Starter
"Extra rebooks at ¬£12 each"        // Premium

// ACTUAL SYSTEM:
- No payment processing for extra rebooks
- Hard daily limits enforced
- No mechanism to buy additional attempts
```

**Customer Impact**: Users will be frustrated when they can't purchase extra rebooks as advertised.
